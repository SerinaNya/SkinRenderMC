# What can this app do?

Send a HTTP request:
```plain
GET http://<your_server>:57680/url/image/both
    ?skinUrl=<your_skin_url>
    &capeUrl=<your_cape_url>
    &nameTag=<your_player_name>
    &definition=1.5
    &transparent=false
```

You will get:

Yes, this app depends on [`bs-community/skinview3d`](https://github.com/bs-community/skinview3d), and [`yushijinhun`](https://github.com/yushijinhun) is the main maintainer of the `skinview3d` project.

Thanks to `yushijinhun` for guiding me during the development of this app.

# Params

- `definition`  
    A float, default: `1.5`  

    `0.8 <= definition <= 3.0`. The higher the value, the clearer the image generated, the higher the resolution and the larger the data size. And vice versa.

- `transparent`
    A boolean, default: `false`  

    When the value is `true`, the background of the generated image will be transparent.

# Deploy

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Require **more than** _2 CPU Core & 2GB RAM_ to run this application.  
> 
> Recommended 4 CPU Core & 4GB RAM.
